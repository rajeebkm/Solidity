// Error

// An error will undo all changes made to the state during a transaction.

// You can throw an error by calling require, revert or assert.

// require is used to validate inputs and conditions before execution.
// revert is similar to require. See the code below for details.
// assert is used to check for code that should never be false. Failing assertion probably means that there is a bug.
// Use custom error to save gas.
